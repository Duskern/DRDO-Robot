# Intention estimation and cognitive emulation for military decision making

This is a research project under DRDO(Defence Research and Development Organization), India.  
In this, we have to emulate a pursuit evasion scenario wherein both, the pursuer and the evader are autonomous agents artificially equipped with intelligence.  
This study aims at evolving models for decision making scenarios such as habitat selection, ambush avoidance and dilemma resolution. The study explores optimal situational scenarios wherein deception is likely to be employed. It proposes a model for employing deception through asymmetric false signaling and evaluates its veracity through intention based assessment. The intention based model enables emulation of the proposed signaling using a probabilistic belief structure. Further the control theory based intention model can be employed for mind reading to judge the opponent's intention to deceive. We have developed a code on Matlab for deception detection, based on input images of the agentâ€™s surroundings and are now on our way to testing this model experimentally on two mobile robots.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
